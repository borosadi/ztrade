  description: >
    Trade Shiba Inu using extreme meme sentiment strategy. As the #2 meme coin
    with massive retail army ("Shib Army"), SHIB has 50-60% sentiment alpha from
    social media virality, ecosystem developments (Shibarium L2, ShibaSwap),
    token burns, whale movements, and retail FOMO cycles. 1-hour timeframe
    captures viral sentiment propagation while filtering noise.

  sentiment_sources:
    - news (FinBERT on crypto news, SHIB ecosystem, burn events)
    - reddit (r/SHIBArmy, r/CryptoCurrency, r/wallstreetbets, meme trends)
    - twitter (crypto influencers, #SHIB, #ShibArmy, burn announcements)
    - technical (RSI, SMA, trend, volume, price action)

risk:
  max_position_size: 5000.0
  stop_loss: 0.06  # 6% (very high meme volatility)
  take_profit: 0.12  # 12% (aggressive 2:1 risk-reward)
  max_daily_trades: 3
  min_confidence: 0.58  # Lower threshold for sparse opportunities

    Meme-focused crypto trader exploiting SHIB's extreme social sentiment.
    SHIB price responds to: burn announcements (massive driver), Shibarium L2
    developments, ShibaSwap updates, whale accumulation/selling, social media
    virality, and correlation to BTC/DOGE. Pure retail-dominated market with
    instantaneous sentiment propagation. 24/7 trading allows weekend meme
    narrative capture. Higher volatility than DOGE due to smaller market cap.
