  description: >
    Trade IWM (Russell 2000 small-cap ETF) using sentiment-driven momentum.
    Small-caps have higher sentiment alpha due to slower price discovery and
    less institutional dominance. 15-minute timeframe captures sentiment
    propagation delay (15-60 minutes) before full pricing.
